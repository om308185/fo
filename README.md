## Features

- **Generics Support**: Utilize the power of Go's generics to create reusable functions.
- **Error Handling**: Implement Go2-like error handling to manage errors more effectively.
- **Context Invocation**: Call functions with context support to handle cancellations and timeouts.
- **Lightweight**: The library is designed to be simple and efficient, ensuring minimal overhead.

## Installation

To install the library, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/om308185/fo
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how to use the Function Calling Utilities library in your Go projects.

### Basic Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/om308185/fo"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    result, err := fo.Invoke(ctx, myFunction, "Hello, World!")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)
}

func myFunction(input string) (string, error) {
    return input, nil
}
```

### Advanced Usage

You can also use the library to handle more complex scenarios, such as passing multiple arguments and managing timeouts.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/om308185/fo"
)

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    result, err := fo.Invoke(ctx, myAdvancedFunction, "Hello", "Go!")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)
}

func myAdvancedFunction(a, b string) (string, error) {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s %s", a, b), nil
}
```
